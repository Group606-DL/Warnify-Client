        We are third year students in the College Of Managment, we tried to
        think of a universal problem in order to solve it as part of the course.
        <br /> After thinking and consulting with the lecturers and instructors
        of the course, we came up with the idea - censoring content of violence
        and explosions for post-trauma and children. <br />
        Our platform gives you an option to upload a video and watch it without all of the sensetive content. <br/>
        We want to give you the watching experience you deserve!
